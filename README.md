# Advent of Code 2023


This repo is where all code for solving Advent of Code for the year 2023 is stored.

## Why am I participating

I want to use this time as an opportunity to improve my skills in programming, to solve problems
efficiently, to add a project to my CV and to use the Rust Programming language which I have had a long interest in but
not had an opportunity to use yet.


## How To Run

On the command line, go into the root directory of the day ( e.g: day01 for Day 1 ),
if there is also one solution for that day, simply running

```shell
cargo run
```

should suffice. If however there are multiple files for different parts of a day and you want 
to run part 2 for example, you need to specify the specific binary like


```shell
cargo run --bin REPLACE 
```

and simply swap REPLACE for the file to run
